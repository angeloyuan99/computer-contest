Introduction
Entry test

What we will learn in CC-2:
 - implementation
     - Array/string manipulation
     - how to debug a program

 - Basic Data structure
     - prefix sum array/difference array
     - list/set/map 
     - stack/queue/deque
 
 - Basic algorithms
     - recursion, back tracking
     - Binary search, sieve
     - BFS/DFS

    CCC(canadian computing competition)
     - Junior level
     - Senior level

    5 questions, each one worth 15 points
    75 points in total

    Junior
    question 1/2 straightforward
    question 3/4 more challenging
    question 5 advanced(recursion)
    
    Prizes: certificates/medals


    Senior
    question 1/2 Basic algorithms(equivalent to 1/2 in Junior)
    question 3/4 Advanced algorithms
    question 5 IOI level questions

    Prizes: certificates/medals/invitations to stage 2

    Why do computer competition

     - Good logic thinking
     - when applying to some departments in U of Waterloo, you may need to provide CCC results
     - recognized by canadian universities, like U of test
     - IOI medals: waterloo olympiad scholarship
     - CCO offers waterloo offer + scholarship
     - Cash prize and one free camp at U of Waterloo
     - Join university ACM team
     - job oppurtunities

    languages

     - CCC competitors are allowed to use any programming languages which is supported at their school
     - CCO, must use C++/C/Java

    is CCC hard?
    
     - Yes

     - If you have no training, its impossible to solve 4 questions in 3 hours

     - Even if you are in junior, its extremely hard to get perfect

     Online Judges
     - DMOJ
